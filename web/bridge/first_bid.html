Responding:


-----------------------------------------------------------
0. See opening.
1. *
2. Partner has a "5-card major" and "opening points":
    a. Do you have have 5 or fewer points?
        Yes > Pass.
    b. Do you have 18 or more points?
        Yes > You probably know what a "Jump-shift" is!
    c. Do you have 4 cards in her suit AND 10 or 11 points?
        Yes > Bid 3 of that suit. (That's a "Limit raise".)
    d. Do you have 3 cards in her suit AND 6 to 9 points?
        Yes > Bid 2 of that suit.
    e. Do you have 10 to 17 points BUT NOT 3 or more cards in her suit?
        Yes > You can bid clubs or diamonds if one of them has 5 or more cards. (You're forced to the 2-level to do this. That's why it's called 2-over-1. It means you have above average points.)
    f. Do you have 6 to 9 points, but you don't have 3 cards in her suit?
        Yes > Bid 1 No Trump. (Kind of a crap out. Tells your partner that you don't have any of the above, but you do have at least a few points.)

3. Partner opens 1 NT (15-17 points, "balanced hand")
    a. Do you have 5 hearts or spades?
        Yes > Bid the suit *below* the suit you have. Then your partner must bid your suit. Then...
    b. Do you have 4 hearts or spades AND 8 or more points?
        Yes > Bid 2 clubs. ("Stayman") Then if your partner has 4 hearts or spades she will bid it. Then you can confirm or deny that you have the same "4-card major". (Btw, don't bid 2 clubs if you have a super "flat" hand: "4-3-3-3".)
    c. Do you have 10 or 11 points? (But no long suits, mentioned above.)
        Yes > Bid 3 NT. (Together you have 25 to 28 points.)
    d. Do you have 8 or 9 points? ((But no long suits.)
        Yes > Bid 2 NT. (Together you have 23 to 26 points.)
    e. Do you have 7 or fewer points? (And not a 5-card major)
        Yes > Pass.

4. Partner has "Opening points", but not a 5-card major
    a. 5 or fewer points? Pass. (Same as #2b above.)
    b. 18+ points? (Jump-shift! Same as #2b above.)
    c. Do you have 4 hearts or spades AND 6 or more points?
        Yes > Bid that suit.
    d. Do you have 6 to 9 points?
        Yes > Bid 1 NT.
